Hi! I'm Filip. My programs and projects are mostly in Python. Those are some programming languages I use:

 - Python
 - Unity C# (or GameMaker)
 - HTML + PHP (by the way I hate doing frontend)
 - Powershell, cmd and bash scripts
etc.

My programs are for Windows, but in future, I'll try to make a program for linux, too. I speak Czech, English, and Italian (learning Italian), 
so if any of these is your native language, feel free to use them in conversations with me! I don't always finish what I start. When It's a minor project,
where there's not much, it's more likely I get bored and don't finish it. If I don't finish a program and you want to finish it yourself, contact me.

Email: filip.houzim@seznam.cz

Email 2 (I don't use it very much): fhouzim@gmail.com

On other developer platforms you can find me under the name "tencmnt_" or "FilipDevStudios". I hope you enjoy my projects!
