Hi! My name's Filip and I'm a young developer from Czechia.

I mostly specialize in making native android apps with kotlin in Jetpack Compose and I'm learning flutter. I also made a lot of python apps in the past, but those were mostly for personal use like Discord bots. I have a lot of unfinished private projects as I don't finish much in one go if it's not something I really need :D. 

I'm fluent in Czech and English, so feel free to use those when communicating with me. You can contact me on my email `imkei.py@mail.com` or `fhouzim@gmail.com` (less frequently used)
