Hi! I'm Filip. My programs and projects are mostly in Python. Those are some programming languages I use:

 - Python
 - Unity C# (or GameMaker)
 - HTML + PHP (backend)
 - Powershell, cmd and bash scripts
etc.

My projects are mainly for Windows, but in the future, I will make versions for linux, too. I speak fluent Czech and English, 
so if any of these is your native language, feel free to use them when communicating with me! I also have a lot of unfinished work.

On other developer platforms you can find me under the name "tencmnt_" or "FilipDevStudios". I hope you enjoy my projects!
